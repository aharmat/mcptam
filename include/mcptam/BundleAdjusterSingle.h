 *
 * The bundle adjustment code has been separated from the MapMaker so that
 *different
 * bundle adjusters can be used depending on need (ie live tracking or
 *calibration).
 *
 * BundleAdjusterSingle uses the ChainBundle class to perform bundle adjustment
 *of
 * MultiKeyFrames where measurements of MapPoints are made through KeyFrames.
 *Unlike
 * BundleAdjusterMulti, the KeyFrames are adjusted individually, ignoring the
 *pose between
 * KeyFrames and their parent MultiKeyFrame (ie almost the same as the Bundle
 *class of PTAM).
 * After adjustment, the parent MultiKeyFrame's pose is set to the pose of the
 *first
 * child KeyFrame, and then the KeyFrames' CamFromBase transforms are updated.
