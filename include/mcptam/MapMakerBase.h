 *
 * The MapMaker of PTAM has been broken up into several different pieces, in
 *order to allow
 * the construction of both a standalone MapMaker as well as a client/server
 *MapMaker with
 * a minimum amount of code duplication that would promote confusion and
 *inconsistency. The
 * inheritance tree looks as follows:
 *
 *                             MapMakerBase
 *                            /          \
 *             MapMakerClientBase      MapMakerServerBase
 *              /              \        /              \
 *    MapMakerClient            MapMaker            MapMakerServer
 *
 * The "client-side" interfaces with the tracker, whereas the "server-side"
 * actually does the optimizations. Both sides can delete map points.
 *
 * MapMakerBase contains everything that is common to both client-side and
 * server-side operations, such as a reference to an underlying map, resetting
 * the map, and some KeyFrame operations.
