 *
 * The bundle adjustment code has been separated from the MapMaker so that
 *different
 * bundle adjusters can be used depending on need (ie live tracking or
 *calibration).
 *
 * BundleAdjusterMulti uses the ChainBundle class to perform bundle adjustment
 *of
 * MultiKeyFrames where measurements of MapPoints are made through KeyFrames.
 * Unlike in BundleAdjusterSingle, the pose between KeyFrames and their parent
 * MultiKeyFrame is kept fixed, only the MultiKeyFrame pose is changed.
