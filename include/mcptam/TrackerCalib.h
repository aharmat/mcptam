/** @brief Inherits from Tracker, allows the detection of a checkerboard in an
 *initialization phase
 *
 *  Unlike Tracker, TrackerCalib tracks only one camera since during calibration
 *the relative poses of the
 *  cameras are not known. Also, it has an initialization phase during which it
 *attempts to find a checkerboard
 *  using CalibImageTaylor. TrackerCalib doesn't add KeyFrames or MultiKeyFrames
 *directly to the map,
 *  but rather signals its intention to add by setting the mbNeedToDrop flag.
 *
 *  The inheritance from Tracker is mostly done to prevent a lot of code reuse,
 *since TrackerCalib is more
 *  a different type of Tracker than a child of it. Therefore, several functions
 *and members of Tracker are not
 *  used. This is not great C++ programming but let's overlook that.
