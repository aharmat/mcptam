 * Most of this code is from the original PTAM, which is
 * Copyright 2008 Isis Innovation Limited
 *
 * This class was extracted from PTAM's CalibImage.h file. While developing
 *CalibImageTaylor,
 * it was necessary to concurrently test it alongside the original CalibImage
 *and the
 * definition of CalibGridCorner in both files was a problem, so it was moved.
 *Now with
 * CalibImageTaylor functional, I could merge this back into CalibImageTaylor.h
 *but haven't
 * found any good reason to do so.
