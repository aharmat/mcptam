 *
 * Parts of this code are from the MapMaker class in the original PTAM, which
 *are
 * Copyright 2008 Isis Innovation Limited
 *
 * The bundle adjustment code has been separated from the MapMaker so that
 *different
 * bundle adjusters can be used depending on need (ie live tracking or
 *calibration).
 *
 * BundleAdjusterCalib uses the ChainBundle class to perform bundle adjustment
 *of
 * MultiKeyFrames where measurements of MapPoints are made through KeyFrames.
 *The problem
 * is set up such that there is only a single transform representing the
 *relative pose
 * between two cameras, and the pose of the first camera within a MultiKeyFrame
 *is identity.
 * For example, in a system with two cameras (camera1 & camera2, represented in
 *KeyFrame form
 * as KF1 and KF2) and two MultiKeyFrames, we have the following pose graph:
 *
 *       world1
 *             \
 *              KF1------KF2
 *             /
 *       world2
 *
 * This way, when calibrating the extrinsic properties of the cameras, we are
 *only solving
 * for a single transform between any two cameras, rather than taking some kind
 *of average
 * of a bunch of different poses.
