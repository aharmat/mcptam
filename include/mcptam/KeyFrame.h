 * \brief Declares the KeyFrame and MultiKeyFrame classes

 *
 *   The class MultiKeyFrame contains a map of "camera name" => "KeyFrame"
 *   as well as a base pose. Individual KeyFrames are fixed with respect to
 *   its parent MultiKeyFrame, and it is the MultiKeyFrame's pose that is
 *   optimized during bundle adjustment during normal operation. During
 *calibration,
 *   the KeyFrame poses are treated differently, see calibration documentation
 *for details.
 *
 *   Some functions have been moved from other parts of PTAM into the KeyFrame
 *   class: refreshing scene depth, calculating the distance to another
 *KeyFrame,
 *   and handling the erasure of measurements. The MultiKeyFrame class also
 *   contains these functions and simply calls the corresponding function
 *   in each of the KeyFrames it owns.
 *
 *
 * Copyright 2008 Isis Innovation Limited
 *   This header declares the data structures to do with keyframes:
 *   structs KeyFrame, Level, Measurement, Candidate.
 *
 *   A KeyFrame contains an image pyramid stored as array of Level;
 *   A KeyFrame also has associated map-point mesurements stored as a vector of
 *Measurment;
 *   Each individual Level contains an image, corner points, and special corner
 *points
 *   which are promoted to Candidate status (the mapmaker tries to make new map
 *points from those.)
 *
 *   KeyFrames are stored in the Map class and manipulated by the MapMaker.
 *   However, the tracker also stores its current frame as a half-populated
 *   KeyFrame struct.
