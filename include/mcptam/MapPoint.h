 * \brief Declaration of MapPoint class
 *
 * Large parts of this code are from the original PTAM, which is
 * Copyright 2008 Isis Innovation Limited
 *
 * The map is made up of a bunch of MapPoints.
 * Each one is just a 3D point in the world;
 * it also includes information on where and in which KeyFrame the point was
 * originally made from, so that pixels from that KeyFrame can be used
 * to search for that point.
 * Also stores stuff like inlier/outlier counts, and private information for
 * both Tracker and MapMaker.
 *

 *
 * MapPoint has been modified to allow the use of multiple cameras by changing
 *the single
 * TrackerData structure to a map of camera name => TrackerData pointers. There
 *is also
 * an atomic integer counter that allows a TrackerData object to indicate that
 *it is using
 * the MapPoint, which prevents its deletion by the MapMaker.
